#ParseCSS


**The stupid idea to write a CSS(3) Parser in JS.**
-----
This is going to be a nice little project of mine: A JS library that parses CSS into ASTs (read: JSON data) so that
  you can do all sorts of intereseting things with it.  
For now, this repo is merely a placeholder and serves no other purpose than to exist, so really, just move 
along, nothing to see here (yet)
